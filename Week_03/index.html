Section: defines a block or group of a specific subject.
It is important to understand that section groups several elements
that relate to each other. For example, if there is one area in which
 there are site links, content, images etc of a common subject, you
 will combine these elements with a section

 Note: Authors are strongly encouraged to view the <div> element as an
 element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable. Use of
 more appropriate elements instead of the <div> element leads to better
 accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.
